##A big part of you work will be the creation of specific designs. Please deliver us the CSS for the following example of a photo page. Note that this CSS has to obey the following business rules: ##
- divide the page into 4 columns with an unknown number of rows
- columns are equal in size with 10px spacing between them
- in every column 1 photo is displayed with the title below
- photos can be either portrait (150px X 200px) or landscape (200px X 150px), but you don’t know that upfront. A row can thus have only landscape, only portrait, or a mix of landscape and portrait photo’s
- the spacing between rows is always 10px. Because of the previous rule, rows can thus have unequal height.
- Photo’s & title are aligned in the center of the column, the title is 5px below the photo ○ the HTML is automatically generated & minified (all superfluous whitespace is removed) with Smarty.
